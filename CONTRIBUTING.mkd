# How to contribute

Contributions are welcome - we want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute
changes that get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines
that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.

## Reporting an Issue

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Check if a ticket already exists for your issue on [GitHub](gh-issues).
* If one does not already exist, [create a new ticket](gh-issues)
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you include in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

## Making Changes

* If you haven't already, create a new issue on [GitHub](gh-issues) for your bug
  fix or new feature.
* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the [proper format](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes in the
  `openxc-it` sub-project
* Run the full test suite to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
    * With an Android device attached, run `mvn clean install -pl
      openxc,openxc-it -am`

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Sign the [Contributor License
  Agreement](http://openxcplatform.com/contributor-license-agreement.html) (CLA)
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the openxc organization.
